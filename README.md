#Esty Items Weekend Project
##Sort through a array of objects from a esty database snippet and javascript data into html. (long way, no methods besides includes)

###Things I learned
  1. Data flow of a loop inside a loop to sort through a object and obtain data from objects keys.
  2. Learned how to use .innerHTML to insert arrays info into a tag and update the html on console side.
  3. Deeper understand of data flow.
